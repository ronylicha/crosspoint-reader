# File Formats

These formats describe the SD-card cache files under `/.crosspoint/epub_<hash>/`.
All POD fields are written in the ESP32 little-endian representation used by
`Serialization.h`; strings are length-prefixed UTF-8.

## `book.bin`

### Version 10

`book.bin` stores EPUB metadata plus lookup tables for spine and TOC entries.
The current firmware writes this version from `BookMetadataCache`.

## `section.bin`

### Version 52

The serialized layout is unchanged. Missing full-block (`U+2588`) and black-square
(`U+25A0`) symbols now use font-sized solid rectangles instead of replacement
glyphs. Rebuild older sections so cached line breaks and word positions match
their new widths.

### Version 50

The header adds `paragraphIndentSpaces` after `extraParagraphSpacing`. The value
participates in cache validation, so sections with different indentation settings
are rebuilt. Version 49 was used by pre-release builds with a different header
layout and is skipped to prevent reuse of those caches.

### Version 48

Version 48 keeps the version 47 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because Hangul text no longer has implicit line-break opportunities between
syllables: Korean words wrap at spaces (like CSS `word-break: keep-all`), and
with hyphenation enabled a word may also split at the end of a line wherever the
CJK line-breaking rules allow, without an inserted hyphen. Justification stretches only word spaces. Cached line breaks and word
positions from version 47 no longer match.

### Version 47

The section header adds signed `characterSpacing` (pixels) and unsigned
`wordSpacingPercent` after `focusReadingEnabled`; both participate in cache
validation. Each TextBlock's BlockStyle stores only `characterSpacing` after
`directionDefined`. Word spacing is resolved into cached word positions during
layout. Sections from earlier versions are rebuilt.

### Version 46

Version 46 keeps the version 45 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because ordered lists now number their items, `list-style-type: none`
suppresses list markers, and `<ul>`/`<ol>` containers contribute their own
margins and padding to child block insets, changing cached word contents and
page layout.

### Version 45

Version 45 keeps the version 44 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because internal EPUB links now preserve CSS superscript and subscript styles,
changing their cached word-style flags and page layout.

### Version 44

Each file in `sections/*.bin` stores one laid-out spine section. The header is
also the cache-busting key: if any layout-affecting setting differs from the
current reader settings, the section is discarded and rebuilt.

Version 44 appends the internal-link rectangles produced during text layout to
each serialized page. The reader uses these rectangles for touch navigation;
older caches are rebuilt because they contain no link geometry.

Version 43 keeps the version 42 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because paragraph base direction now excludes direction changes from inline
elements.

Version 42 keeps the version 41 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because closing a block now strips inherited vertical margins and padding.

Version 41 keeps the version 40 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because simple HTML table rows are now laid out as positioned columns rather
than flattened paragraphs with synthetic row/cell labels.

Version 40 keeps the version 39 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because ruby groups now remain intact when large text blocks are soft-flushed.

Version 39 keeps the version 38 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because image top margins are now clamped to keep full-height images within the
page viewport.

Version 38 keeps the version 37 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because Focus Reading now permits line breaks at visible hyphens and dashes
and hyphenates focus-split words as a whole, changing cached page layout.

Version 37 increases the fixed-size footnote href field from 96 to 256 bytes.
This changes each serialized footnote record from 128 to 288 bytes, so older
section caches must be discarded and rebuilt.

Version 36 keeps the version 35 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because ruby and justified text positioning and CJK line breaking now use
corrected word measurements, so version 35 cached page layouts no longer match.

Version 35 adds a header offset and a `uint32_t` entry per page for the
visible-text offset LUT. The other section LUTs remain unchanged.

Version 34 is binary-identical to version 33. The version was bumped because
word-gap suppression was narrowed to tokens glued together in the source: v33
dropped the gap between any two words meeting at a CJK break opportunity, which
collapsed the spaces between Hangul words, so v33 word positions no longer match
what the layout engine now produces.

Version 30 is binary-identical to version 29. The version was bumped because
Arabic contextual shaping changed text measurement (`getTextAdvanceX` now
measures the shaped visual text), so word positions cached by v29 no longer
match what `drawText` renders.

Version 28 introduced serialized word style bits for underline, strikethrough,
superscript, and subscript. The format also includes:

- cache-busting fields for paragraph alignment, hyphenation, embedded CSS,
  image rendering mode, and Focus Reading
- page offset LUT
- per-page visible-text offset LUT (zero-based Unicode codepoints in `<body>`)
- anchor-to-page map for fragment and footnote navigation
- paragraph and list-item LUTs retained for navigation and legacy sync fallback
- optional per-word Focus Reading split metadata
- per-page footnote entries
- serialized word style bits for underline, strikethrough, superscript, and
  subscript
- flat TextBlock word storage (v29): per-word arrays plus one shared
  NUL-terminated text blob, replacing v28's length-prefixed word strings. The
  on-disk order mirrors the in-RAM arena so the firmware reads a whole block
  payload with a single allocation and a single SD read

## CLX1 — library index (`.crosspoint/library.idx`)

Written by `lib/LibraryIndex/LibraryBuilder.cpp`, read by `LibraryIndexFile`. One
file describing every book on the card, so the shelf can sort and search
thousands of titles without opening any of them.

Current format version: **3**. Normal library reads accept version 3 only.
Version 2 remains readable through `openForReconciliation` so an automatic
rebuild can preserve the arrival history while collecting series metadata.

### Layout

| Section | Offset | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Header | 0 | 64 bytes, `ClixHeader` |
| Folders | `folderStart` | length-prefixed paths, one per folder |
| Records | `recordStart` | `bookCount` × 128-byte `ClixRecord` |
| Permutations | `permStart` | `bookCount` u16 author order, then arrival order, then series order |
| Series groups | `seriesGroupsStart` | first position of each group in series order; `bookCount` u16 slots reserved |
| Name blob | `nameStart` | per record: path hash, name, canonical author, title, source author, series, optional series index |

The header and record strides remain **64** and **128 bytes**. Version 3 uses
six formerly reserved header bytes:

| Header field | Byte offset | Size | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `seriesGroupsStart` | 44 | 4 | absolute byte offset of the series group directory |
| `seriesGroupCount` | 48 | 2 | number of populated group entries |
| `reserved` | 50 | 14 | remaining reserved bytes |

The directory has capacity for one group per book, but only its first
`seriesGroupCount` entries are populated. Each entry is a starting **row in the
series permutation**, not a record ordinal. Group starts increase strictly,
with the first at zero. The reader exposes `bookCount` as the end sentinel;
this sentinel is not written after the populated entries. An empty index has
zero groups; a nonempty index must have between one and `bookCount` groups.

The arrival permutation runs oldest first, keyed by the record's FAT
modification time (when the file landed on the card); `firstSeen` — the
build-assigned discovery counter — breaks ties and carries books whose
filesystem reports no time. Fold version 3 introduced the timestamp key; a
fold bump rebuilds ranks while preserving `firstSeen`.
Fold version 4 preserves leading articles in title sort and search keys.

Sections are 512-byte aligned so each starts on an SD block boundary.

For `N = bookCount`, the permutation offsets are:

```text
author row k:  permStart + 2*k
arrival row k: permStart + 2*(N+k)
series row k:  permStart + 2*(2*N+k)       # version 3 only
```

Version-aware section arithmetic uses `alignUp(x)` to round to the next
512-byte boundary:

```text
folderStart = 512
recordStart = alignUp(folderStart + folderLen)
permStart   = alignUp(recordStart + 128*N)

version 3:
  seriesGroupsStart = alignUp(permStart + 6*N)
  nameStart         = alignUp(seriesGroupsStart + 2*N)

version 2, reconciliation only:
  seriesGroupsStart = 0
  nameStart         = alignUp(permStart + 4*N)

selfSize = nameStart + nameLen
```

For example, with three books and seven bytes of folder records, both formats
place records at 1024 and permutations at 1536. Version 3 places the group
directory at 2048 and names at 2560. Version 2 has no group directory and places
names at 2048. A version 2 file must never be interpreted with version 3 offsets.

### Records are exactly 128 bytes

A fixed stride is what lets the reader seek straight to record *n* without an
offset table, and read a screenful in one 4 KB block. `static_assert` enforces it.

Each record carries `fold[96]`, the title normalised for search and sorting —
accents stripped, case dropped, leading articles preserved — and `authorKey[12]`,
the author's words folded and sorted so that "Victor Hugo" and "Hugo Victor" group as
one person. `authorKey` is a GROUPING key, not an ordering one: the shelf orders by
surname, derived separately from the display name.

The byte before the folded title records metadata extraction status: not
attempted, extracted, or failed. The final four bytes contain the packed FAT
modification date and time returned by SdFat. A zero timestamp is not trusted.
These fields occupy the alignment and reserved bytes from version 1, so the
record remains exactly 128 bytes.

The header records whether EPUB metadata extraction was enabled for the build.
This prevents a metadata-disabled rebuild from making filename fallbacks look
fresh to a later metadata-enabled build.

### The name blob

Per record, at `nameStart + nameOff`:

```text
[u64 pathHash]    FNV-1a fingerprint of the complete path
[nameLen bytes]  filename, without the directory
[u8][author]     display author, one spelling chosen per authorKey across the library
[u8][title]      the book's own title, or length 0 if it never gave one
[u8][source]     cleaned author spelling before the library-wide spelling vote
[u8 seriesLen][series]  UTF-8 series name; length 0 means no series
[u8 hasIndex]          0 or 1
[float32 index]        present only when hasIndex is 1
```

The final three fields are the version 3 extension. The float uses the
ESP32's four-byte little-endian representation; it must be finite. For example,
series `Cycle` with index 2.5 ends with:

```text
05 43 79 63 6c 65 01 00 00 20 40
```

No series and no index are represented by `00 00`. The builder writes a series
index only for a nonempty series key. Reader methods expose missing series and
index as valid empty values. They validate the extension within the current
record's blob boundary, including the exact remaining float size, flag range,
and finiteness. A truncated or malformed extension fails rather than reading
into the next book. Float bytes are copied with `memcpy`, avoiding unaligned
loads on ESP32-C3.

The filename must stay the first textual field and stay the filename: `readPath`
rebuilds a book's path from it, so writing the display title there makes the book
impossible to open. That was a real defect, and it is why title has its own field.

The source author is separate from the displayed canonical author so a later
rebuild can repeat the spelling vote after books are added or removed. Existing
display reads still stop at the author or title fields and retain their offsets.

Version 2 blobs stop after the source author. Reconciliation readers expose
empty series metadata for those records; they do not attempt to read an extension.

### Series order and grouping

The builder normalises the stored series name to NFC and groups by the full
folded key of that name. Group identity does not use a truncated prefix.
Named series sort by that key; the empty key forms the last group, displayed as
**No series**. Within a series, books with a finite numeric index come first in
ascending numeric order, followed by books without an index. The folded title
then breaks ties, followed by the record ordinal for deterministic ordering.

`seriesGroupStart(group)` locates each folder's range without loading all group
names. The series view can project book row identifiers independently of a
search: at the 4,096-book limit, series identifiers and search identifiers each
require at most 8 KiB. This is separate from the builder's temporary staging
and sorting buffers and does not mean the entire index is resident in RAM.

### Migration from version 2

Opening an old version 2 index in the library triggers a version 3 rebuild.
The reconciliation path reads the structurally valid legacy header, records,
path hashes, and two permutations. It preserves each matched book's
`firstSeen` and the header's `nextFirstSeen`. Metadata reuse requires the current
format, so migration performs an OPF metadata pass for eligible EPUBs to collect
title, author, series, and series index together. Subsequent version 3 rebuilds
can reuse metadata under the freshness checks below.

The interrupted-install recovery path also accepts a structurally valid
version 2 backup for reconciliation. It does not require deleting the old index
or resetting arrival order. Unsupported formats cannot provide this legacy
history. The library metadata pass does not change the EPUB `book.bin` format.

### Freshness and unchanged rebuilds

Reconciliation treats the persisted 64-bit complete-path fingerprint as the
book identity. Metadata is reused only when the current format, fingerprint,
size, nonzero FAT timestamp, fold version, metadata mode, and expected
extraction status agree.
EPUBs with a zero timestamp or a previous extraction failure are parsed again.

If every current record reuses metadata, the old and new counts agree, and no
unreadable entry was seen, the staging files are discarded and the live index is
left byte-for-byte unchanged. A normal rebuild action is therefore a freshness
check, not a forced metadata reread.

### Header flags

`RANKS_DEGRADED` says one or more orders fell back to walk order because a
checked sort allocation failed. Title and author each use a phase-local
`SortKey[bookCount]` allocation (14 bytes per book, 57,344 bytes at the 4,096-book
format ceiling); the first array is released before the second is requested.
Sorting is therefore best effort through the full format limit rather than
being disabled at an arbitrary library size.

`DEDUP_DEGRADED` says a directory exceeded the fixed 1024-entry duplicate-key
buffer, or that its fallible 8 KiB allocation failed. The walk still indexes
every enumerated book; it only stops remembering additional identities for
duplicate-dirent detection, so a damaged FAT may expose duplicates but cannot
make a real book disappear.

`selfSize` is the expected file size. Comparing it against the real one is a free
truncation guard: a build cut short by a power failure cannot pass.
